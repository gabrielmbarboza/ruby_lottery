# Ruby Lottery

This project presents lucky numbers (Numbers that were drawn most often) for the Brazilian lottery ([Megasena](http://loterias.caixa.gov.br/wps/portal/loterias/landing/megasena)) and the ultimate goal is to research the creation of ruby threads and create a CLI.

Execute the script:

`$ ruby lotto.rb`

```
Commands:
  lotto load                      # Load tens
  lotto lucky                     # Show lucky numbers
  lotto random [GAMES]            # Print random tens
  lotto version                   # Print version

```
