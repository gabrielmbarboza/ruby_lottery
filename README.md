# Ruby Lottery

This project presents lucky numbers (Numbers that were drawn most often) for the Brazilian lottery ([Megasena](http://loterias.caixa.gov.br/wps/portal/loterias/landing/megasena)) and the ultimate goal is to research the creation of ruby threads and create a CLI.

Execute the script:

> ruby lotto.rb
